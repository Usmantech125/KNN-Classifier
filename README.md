# 🤖 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier – Codveda Internship Task 3 (Updated)

This project is part of the **Codveda Machine Learning Internship**, where I implemented and evaluated a classification model using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm on the **Iris dataset**.

---

## 📌 Task Objectives

- Build a KNN classifier on a labeled dataset.
- Evaluate the performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision and Recall
- Experiment with multiple values of K and compare results.

---

## 🧰 Libraries & Tools

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn & matplotlib

---

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Standardized the dataset using `StandardScaler`.
2. **Model Training**
   - Used `KNeighborsClassifier` for training.
   - Tested different values of K (from 1 to 10).
3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall.
   - Visualized the **Confusion Matrix**.
   - Plotted accuracy trends across different K values.

---

## 📈 Results Summary

- Accuracy varied with different K values.
- **K = 5** showed a balanced performance with ~96% accuracy.
- Confusion matrix and classification report provided deeper performance insights.
